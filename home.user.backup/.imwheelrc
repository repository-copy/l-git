# Here's what you need to do to change the scroll speed of the mouse wheel if your desktop environment doesn't have an option for this:
#
### 1. Install imwheel.
# sudo apt-get install imwheel
#
### 2. Create a file called ".imwheelrc" with your preferred way
# gedit ~/.imwheelrc
#
# And in this file, paste the following:
# ".*"
# None,      Up,   Button4, 3
# None,      Down, Button5, 3
# Control_L, Up,   Control_L|Button4
# Control_L, Down, Control_L|Button5
# Shift_L,   Up,   Shift_L|Button4
# Shift_L,   Down, Shift_L|Button5
#
# "3" at the end of lines two and three represent the number of lines to scroll
# ("3" should be default) - modify this number to suit your needs. Once you're done, save the file.
#
# The first (".*") line from the code used above represents is used to specify in
# which applications to use those settings. ".*" means everywhere,
# but you can also apply application-specific settings by changing ".*" to the window name (and add multiple application-dependent settings).
# Run "man imwheel" for more information.
#
# And finally, the last 4 lines in the code above are there to allow Ctrl / Shift with mouse scroll wheel up / down
# to work (for instance, to allow zooming in on a webpage in the web browser, etc.), which is the default behaviour
#
### 3. Start imwheel (type "imwheel --kill" in a terminal). "--kill" is used to make sure other running instances are terminated,
# so they don't interfere. This is important for a proper setup (another way to make sure imwheel is not running is to just use "killalll imwheel").
#
# Also, if you have back / forward navigation buttons on your mouse,
# they will stop working using the configuration we've used above.
# In such cases, you should launch imwheel like this: imwheel --kill --buttons "4 5"
# and the back / forward buttons should work
#
### 4. Since these settings are only applied when imwheel is running, you should add imwheel to startup
# Also, like I mentioned above, if you have back / forward mouse navigation buttons,
# use the following command instead of simply running "imwheel --kill"
# or else those buttons won't work: imwheel --kill --buttons "4 5"
#
# It's important to mention that imwheel applies the settings available in ~/.imwheelrc when the application starts
# and it doesn't update when changing the configuration file.
# So if you modify the configuration file, you'll need to close imwheel
# and start it again to apply / test the changes (you can close/kill it using the following command: "killall imwheel" or run new instances with "--kill").
#
# Notes:
# - this will most probably not fix issues such as very fast scrolling, if you encounter such an issue,
# you can try unplugging and then plugging the mouse back (from what I've read, that seems to solve the issue in most cases);
# - if you only want to change the scroll wheel speed in Firefox and Chrome,
# you can do this from within the app or using an extension: Firefox | Chrome, etc.
